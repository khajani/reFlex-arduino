# ðŸ¦¾ ReFlex: The Teleoperated Hand 
ReFlex is a teleoperated robotic hand project where a wooden hand mimics the real-time finger movements of the user. By wearing a sensor glove equipped with flex sensors, the bending of each finger is captured and translated into proportional movements of the wooden hand using stepper motors and string actuation.
