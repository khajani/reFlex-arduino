# ü¶æ ReFlex: The Teleoperated Hand 
ReFlex is a teleoperated robotic hand project where a wooden hand mimics the real-time finger movements of the user. By wearing a sensor glove equipped with flex sensors, the bending of each finger is captured and translated into proportional movements of the wooden hand through a string-and-elastic mechanism that mimics the biomechanics of how tendons pull fingers closed and ligaments restore them

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- The user wears a work glove fitted with flex sensors on each finger
- Finger bending changes the resistance of the sensors, which is read by the Arduino Uno
- The Arduino maps these readings to motor rotations
- Stepper motors pull strings attached to the IKEA wooden hand‚Äôs fingers, making the fingers close
- Elastic bands restore the fingers to their neutral positions

This allows the wooden hand to mirror the user‚Äôs finger motions in real time.
